# Power analyses

Within this  session we'll spend a fair amount of time on talking about `power analyses`, `effect sizes`, `design efficiency` and `sample size calculations` as a necessary prerequisite regarding study planning, interpretation and outcome sharing, again also with a focus on `open & reproducible science` as well as `FAIR` principles. 

Setting up and planning a new study is hard and super complex. Among the most crucial factors are setting up a `design` that in combination with a certain `sample size` can achieve enough `power` to detect an `effect` of interest. However, it's worse without clear `outlines`, `documentation` and `standardization`. More and more, a respective `a-prior power analysis` or `sample size` calculation is required by `IRB`, for `grants,` for `pre-prints`, etc. . However, what are the important steps of the respective approaches & how should they be conducted? At what point do I need think about incorporating `open & reproducible science`? Are there tools & resources I can use? All these and more questions will be addressed in this session.   

#### Objectives📍 
- learn about aspects of `power analyses`, `design efficiency` & `effect sizes` 
- get to know respective tools & resources
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time
