# Data management & sharing

Within this second session we'll spend a fair amount of time on talking about `project & data management` as the necessary prerequisite for any successful research work, specifically with a focus on `open & reproducible science` as well as `FAIR` principles. 

Research is hard and super complex. However, it's worse without clear `outlines`, `documentation` and `standardization`. What are important steps of the `research process` & how should they be documented? At what point do I need think about incorporating `open & reproducible science`? Are there tools & resources I can use? All these and more questions will be addressed in this session.   

#### Objectives📍
- learn about aspects of `data management` & `data sharing` 
- get to know respective tools & resources
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time
