Besides the [Lectures](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/lectures/pages/lectures.html) and [Tutorials](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/tutorials/pages/tutorials.html), this initiative of the [T32 Neuroscience of Human Cognition](https://cogns.northwestern.edu/Training.html) program also entails direct support of interested members through individual and lab `consultations` covering the following topics:


- **`data science`**, including:
  - `data standardization` and `management`
  - `preprocessing` and `analyses`
  - `visualization` and `evaluation`
  - `analysis workflows`
  
- **`AI`**, including:
  - `development` of new and `application` of existing `models`
  - `fine-tuning` of existing `models`
  - `model evaluation`

- **`computational work`**, including:
  - `programming` in `bash`, `python` and `R` (other languages such as `HTML` or `Matlab` are also supported)
  - `version control` for `code` and `data`
  - `computational environments`, e.g. `virtualization` and `HPC`
  - `software development` and `continuous integration`

- **`open and reproducible science`**, including:
  - `data` and `code sharing`
  - `data management plans`
  - open `repositories`
  - `reliability`, `robustness`, `reproducibility` and `generalizability` of `analyses`

This concerns active, ie currently running projects, as well as the preparation and submission of grants.
