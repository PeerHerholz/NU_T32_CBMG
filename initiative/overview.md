# Overview & procedure
  
Through this initiative we aim to provide comprehensive training and support concerning all things `data science/management` and `open/reproducible science` for the `Neuroscience of Human Cognition`. To do so, we will follow a “learning by doing” approach in a tripartite manner. Starting from [overview lectures](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/lectures/pages/lectures.html), we will [go through different tutorials](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/tutorials/pages/tutorials.html) and provide [direct support via consultations for individuals and labs](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/consultations/pages/consultations.html). We actively seek out realistic examples and workflows that mimic the lifecycle of real-world projects, trying to present you with both a respective overview and hands-on experience. 

Below you'll find an introduction slide deck, providing a respective overview.

You can directly access the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aykYzU7exMbxLhqD6a9ys1wuvPvtQ0rfIKIg2COj7Kg/present).


All of this following [open science principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) as outlined in the [rainbow of open science practices](https://zenodo.org/record/1147025#.YWbeymYzblw) below and the aim to enable you to critically evaluate scientific research. Along this way we will also talk about important topics such as [#DEI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEI?src=hashtag_click) and systematic biases. For a rather precise outline of the course, please consult the respective section.

## The framework and setup

All workshop materials will be provided within the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) format you're currently looking at, free for everyone to check and try out, as well as utilize further. The workshop itself will use a mixture of slides, code and other media within presentations, practical hands-on sessions and discussion rounds to enable a holistic introduction paired with firsthand experience. Depending on a given participant's computational resources and infrastructure, we provide multiple ways to participate in the workshop as outlined in the [Setup for the workshop](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/setup.html) section.    

## Instructors

To provide a holistic introduction into the mentioned aspects and the respective subcomponents, we assembled a stellar team of instructors, i.e. the main team, as well as contributors. You can find the main team below and get further information via clicking on the respective names.

```{admonition} How to address one another?
:class: dropdown
When contacting us, please refrain from using titles when addressing us and super formal language, using our first names is fine and it’s way more important that the content is respectful, fair and constructive (We aim for the same when we reply). However, please let us know if you have a preferred way of interacting with other folks, including how you would liked to be addressed, your pronouns and the level of formality.
```


### How to reach the instructors

The contact information of the instructors are as follows:

- Office hours: please contact the team member you would like to talk to via Email
- E-mail: please follow the links above
- preferred mode of contact: usually online to save time and effort for everyone but in-person is fine too!

### Gimme the details

Below you will find important details regarding the course summarized in a compact form. Please consult and familiarize yourself with the information presented there prior to and/or within the first few days of the course. 

#### When and where

As this won't be a "classic" course that entails weekly lectures/assignments, etc. but instead utilizes a different outline that is oriented along the research process, we will have sessions with varying content. Combined with a strong focus on project work and direct support, we will organize some meetings as we go. Thus, please watch out for E-Mails/Discord notifications! However, we will definitely meet once a month during the `CBMG hours`, Wednesdays at 12 PM.

The in-person meetings will either take place in [Simpson-Querrey 1M-200, Krantz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c4vQKHK5xqhRGmhx9)

#### Can I use my calculator?

For this initiative you will need frequent access to a computer. None of the topics that we will be going through will be very computationally intensive, so this does not need to be a modern or "fast" computer. Still, it will need to be running a standard operating system like Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. Unfortunately, tablets running mobile operating systems (iOS, Android) probably won't work for this purpose. If this is an issue for you, please get in touch with the instructors as soon as possible so that we can try to figure out a solution. Regarding software and installation thereof, please check the next section.

<p align="center"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/DHqth0hVQoIzS" width="240" height="103" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><p align="center"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/maths-DHqth0hVQoIzS">via GIPHY</a></p></p>

#### How do I get all the software and do I have to apply for a loan to get it?

Don't worry at all. First, in order to help you get all the software required for this endeavor, a [comprehensive installation instruction](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/setup.html) was compiled. In a step-by-step manner it guides you through the installation process, covering several `OS`: `windows`, `macos` and `linux`. Second, everything will be completely free of charge as we will only use publicly available [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). Why? Because supporting trainees via [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) is just not fair and won't help anyone: trainees have to obtain licenses or use those from the university (which usually doesn't have enough for everyone), leading to tremendous problems regarding inequity now and in the future. Additionally, [opens-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) can do everything, if not more, what [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) can and is furthermore usually better supported, tested and documented, creating a fantastic sense of community.

#### Where is everything?

All course materials (lecture slides, lecture demo notebooks, lab notebooks, etc.) will be available on the [course website](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/index.html), i.e. the one you're looking at right now. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) you are free to explore, enhance and share. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up for the entire duration of this initiative and beyond, ideally to the end of the internet. The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout.

### How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback

It’s great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.

That said, to ensure that we’re respecting everyone's time and thus will mainly answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9AM-5PM). The instructors are also going to do their best to stick to these working hours. However, they know that’s not when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to post messages whenever is best for you while knowing that if you post late at night or on a weekend, you may not get a response until the next weekday. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question.

If you have:

- questions about course content - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so either use the [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) plugin, the `discord` channel, the `e-mail` list or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/peerherholz/NU_T32_CBMG/issues).

- a technical  question - come to office hours (or post to `discord`). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished ‘in person’ where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. However, if that is not possible, we can schedule an in-person meeting or post your question to `discord`. Be as specific as you can and help us by providing examples and code.

- been stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren’t even really sure where to start - Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn’t working. That’s OK - we’ve all been there! IF you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren’t exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on `discord`). If you don’t have a specific question, include the information you have (what you’re stuck on, the code you’ve been trying that hasn’t been happening, and/or the error messages you’ve been getting).

- questions about course logistics - first, check the [overview](https://peerherholz.github.io/NU_T32_CBMG/setup.html). If you can’t find the answer there, post on `discord`.

- something super cool to share related to the content or want to talk about a topic in further depth - feel free to post on `discord`, contact the instructors or come to office hours. 

- some feedback about the initiative you want to share anonymously - If you’ve been offended by an example, really liked or disliked materials, or wish there were something covered that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the anonymous [Microsoft Form]()

*This form can be taken down at any time if it’s not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.
